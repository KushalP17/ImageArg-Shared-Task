def prompt_with_examples(prompt, examples=[]):
    """
    Constructs a structured prompt string for language models with instructional examples.

    This function takes an initial prompt and a list of example prompt-response pairs, then 
    formats them into a single string enclosed by special start and end tokens used for 
    instructing the model. Each example is included in the final prompt, which could be 
    beneficial for models that take into account the context provided by examples.

    Parameters:
    - prompt (str): The main prompt to be processed by the language model.
    - examples (list of tuples): A list where each tuple contains a pair of strings 
      (example_prompt, example_response). Default is an empty list.

    Returns:
    - str: A string with the structured prompt and examples formatted for a language model.
    
    Example usage:
    ```
    main_prompt = "Translate the following sentence into French:"
    example_pairs = [("Hello, how are you?", "Bonjour, comment Ã§a va?"),
                     ("Thank you very much!", "Merci beaucoup!")]
    formatted_prompt = prompt_with_examples(main_prompt, example_pairs)
